Simulates a Professor and Students During Office Hours
There is 1 professor an many students. There are a limited of seats available for students to sit on as they wait for their turn. 
Thus semaphores are utilized to ensure the integrity of data (the number of chairs available) as well as if the professor is ready to attend to another student.
The professor and student threads are synchronized as a result.
